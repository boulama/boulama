### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
my name is Boulama, Aerospace Engineering student & self-taught software engineer.  
I own an nlp as a service platform [tinq.ai](https://tinq.ai).  
I love to code and express my creativity and solve problems using code.  

### Languages & tools I use on a daily basis:

#### General Purpose

[![General Purpose](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python,matlab,julia,c,cpp,nodejs)](https://skillicons.dev)

#### IoT & Robotics

[![IoT & Robotics](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=raspberrypi,arduino,ros)](https://skillicons.dev)

#### Web Development

[![Web development](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=php,laravel,mysql,javascript,vue)](https://skillicons.dev)
  
I have a couple of gists here: [my gists](https://gist.github.com/boulama). These are mostly codes that I write to solve some (silly-ish) problems I might encounter every now and then.

#### interests:
- machine learning (computational linguistics)
- single-stage-to-orbit rockets (sstos)
- small-lift launch vehicles
- space debris elimination (SpaDE)

#### current projects:
- [kanuri.info](https://kanuri.info/) -- I built a dictionary for my mother tongue to English and French using OCR & ML.
- [tinq.ai](https://tinq.ai) - my first SaaS business, nlp as a service platform (currently 35 paying users).
